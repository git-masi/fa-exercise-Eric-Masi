Notes on the project:

Mobile first?
The first thing I noticed was that the mockup seemed to be for a laptop screen, or at the very least it was not a mobile screen. I know that it is very common these days to do designs mobile first, but given this mockup specifically I decided to code desktop first.

Sizes
There weren’t any indications of sizes anywhere in the mockup or in the directions as far as I could tell. This is something that I would generally inquire about because I know a lot of time designers have particular sizing in mind for sections, text, etc. For the sake of time I decided to use my own judgement. But to be clear I would seek out more information about something like this.

Font-weight
The document I received says:

Header Font:
Open Sans Bold  on Google Font ( will not match the mock-ups typekit font but that’s ok) 

Deck Copy Font:
Open Sans Bold  on Google Font ( will not match the mock-ups typekit font but that’s ok) 

Body Font
Open Sans Bold  on Google Font

I noticed that it specifies “bold” for all the various fonts, but that didn’t make a lot of sense because there were clearly bolded elements in the paragraphs within the mock so I assumed that it meant just the various headlines would be bold and any clearly bolded elements. This is something I would ask about generally.

Color
The only color that wasn’t specified was the main heading in the first section. I tried the red specified for the last section but I didn’t like it so I chose something different. Of course if it had been specified I would have used that color.

JavaScript
I wasn’t sure what all to do here so I thought I would just give you some CSS animations triggered by JavaScript. I actually had a lot of fun playing around with different types of animations and had to scale it back because I added too much and decided that it was just obnoxious. In the end I hope that this demonstrates things like: dom manipulation, arrow functions, timing events, array methods (for each).

Bootstrap
I decided not to use bootstrap (or any other CSS framework) because I think I code faster in plain CSS and this project didn’t have any buttons or forms or anything like that were Bootstrap really shines (in my opinion). I would of course be happy to use a framework if the project requires it.
Folder Structure
This was a small project and I didn’t actually download the images so I didn’t use any kind of folder structure. On larger projects I would of course break the files up into different folders.
